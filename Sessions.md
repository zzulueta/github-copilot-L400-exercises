L400 Advanced GitHub Copilot Sessions

Overview:
This series of three advanced sessions is designed for experienced developers and team leads looking to deepen their expertise in GitHub Copilot. Each session focuses on practical applications of Copilot in real-world scenarios, enhancing code quality, review processes, and team collaboration.

Session 1:
**Learning Description:**
Dive deep into Copilot’s contextual intelligence and chat-based workflows to improve local code quality, maintainability, and developer velocity. Learn how Copilot interprets context from repositories, files, and symbols — and how to guide it effectively for consistent, high-quality code outcomes.
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand inline, chat, and contextual scopes in Copilot.
- Optimise Copilot performance by managing file- and repo-level context.
- Create and apply Copilot Instructions for organisational style and standards.
- Use Copilot Chat commands (/fix, /explain, /tests, /optimise) for debugging and refactoring.
- Apply Copilot for inline documentation, test coverage, and clean commit hygiene.

Session 2:
**Learning Description:**
Explore how Copilot Chat transforms code reviews by providing context-aware insights, reasoning, and quality suggestions. Participants will learn how to create and refine review workflows that embed transparency, traceability, and improved collaboration directly within GitHub.
**Learning Objectives:**
- Conduct contextual code reviews using Copilot Chat.
- Build a custom review chat mode tuned to team workflows and standards.
- Integrate repository context (README, style guide, PR templates) into review sessions.
- Use Copilot Tools for intelligent search, documentation lookup, and inline review support.
- Apply conversational feedback loops to improve review depth and developer engagement.

Session 3:
**Learning Description:**
Bring it all together by leveraging Copilot to embed governance and quality gates within developer workflows — without relying on external CI/CD tools. This session focuses on sustainable, transparent, and traceable engineering practices driven by Copilot interactions.
**Learning Objectives:**
- Use Copilot Chat to establish lightweight governance and peer review processes.
- Reinforce consistency and quality through conversational review and summary tools.
- Apply Copilot for auto-documentation, PR summaries, and knowledge sharing.
- Execute a full end-to-end quality workflow: refactor → review → document.
- Present outcomes demonstrating Copilot’s role in CBA’s internal governance model.
